I am currently a Data Scientist at the NFL. 

I graduated with a Masterâ€™s of Science in Business Analytics from UT, and previously a Master's of Science in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A&M. My research was focused on  nuclear proliferation actions by states in order to quantify the associated level of risk. 

Away from my keyboard, I enjoy basketball and pickleball. I'd also call myself a dosa and pizza entusiast.
