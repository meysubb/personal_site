This project was inspired by my love for CFB, and also inspired by the EPA/WPA models provided in nflscrapR by Ron Yurko et al. 

This package is now archived. Access to cfb data can be found in [cfbfastR](https://cfbfastr.sportsdataverse.org/).

Huge S/O to [CFB_Data](https://collegefootballdata.com/) for making college play by play data accessible to everyone.
